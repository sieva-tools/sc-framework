# SC (SievaTeam-Claude) Skill

A team-oriented task management system that combines deep codebase understanding with structured capture→plan→work workflows. Merges team collaboration features with power-pack-style task processing.

**Core Philosophy:** Understand the codebase first. Think before coding. Ask questions when uncertain. Test everything. Track everything.

## CRITICAL: Capture vs Work Separation

**`/sc add` and `/sc work` are SEPARATE actions. Do NOT combine them.**

### `/sc add <task>` — Capture ONLY
- Rephrase prompt into optimized detailed version (using agent)
- Save rephrased prompt to `pp/$USER/rephrased/`
- Ask clarifying questions (ALWAYS — both Normal and Overnight modes)
- Match vague terms to UI Element Index from CODEBASE_MAP.md
- Enter plan mode for medium/complex tasks
- Save plan to `pp/$USER/plans/`
- Create REQ file(s) with references to rephrased prompt and plan
- **NEVER write code**
- **NEVER implement anything**
- End with: "Ready to implement? Run `/sc work`"

### `/sc work` — Implementation ONLY
- Follow the workflow in [work action](./actions/work.md) step by step
- Check session locks (team feature)
- Move files through: `pp/$USER/` → `pp/$USER/working/` → `pp/$USER/archive/`
- Generate tests, run test loop, create verification
- Log to `.claude-team/history/tasks.jsonl`

**NEVER implement during `/sc add`. NEVER skip file operations during `/sc work`.**

---

## CRITICAL: Follow the Workflow

**When `/sc work` is invoked, you MUST follow the workflow in [work action](./actions/work.md) step by step.**

**NEVER:**
- Implement directly without creating folder structure first
- Skip the claim step (moving REQ to working/)
- Delegate file operations to agents
- Skip test generation (if Playwright enabled)
- Skip archiving completed work

**ALWAYS:**
- Determine current user: `$USER` (e.g., durga, john)
- Run `mkdir -p pp/$USER/{config,research,working,archive,rephrased,plans} .claude-team/{sessions,history} tests/pp tests/pp/screenshots` first
- Move REQ file to `pp/$USER/working/` before implementation
- Update `pp/$USER/STATE.md` at each step
- Generate Playwright tests yourself (not via agents)
- Run the test loop until pass/skip
- Move completed work to `pp/archive/`
- Log completion to `.claude-team/history/tasks.jsonl`

---

## Update Check (First-Time Per Session)

On the **first `/sc` command** in a new session, **before asking setup questions**, check for updates:

1. Run this command silently:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/sc && git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null && git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count 2>/dev/null
```

2. **If count > 0** (updates available):
   - Read the local VERSION file: `cat ~/.claude/skills/sc/VERSION`
   - Read the remote VERSION: `git show origin/main:VERSION 2>/dev/null`
   - **Auto-pull the update:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/.claude/skills/sc && git pull origin main 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - Display to the user:
   ```
   sc updated! v[old] → v[new]
   Restart your Claude Code session to get all changes.
   ```
   - Then continue with session setup as normal

3. **If count = 0 or fetch fails** (up to date or offline):
   - Say nothing, proceed silently to session setup

**This check runs ONCE per session.**

---

## Session Setup (MANDATORY — Every New Session)

**CRITICAL: On the FIRST `/sc` command in a new session, you MUST ask these FOUR questions. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

**Rules:**
- **ALWAYS ask these 4 questions at the start of every new Claude Code session**
- **NEVER skip these questions** because you "already know" the preferences
- **NEVER persist these preferences** to MEMORY.md or any auto-memory file
- Previous session preferences are INVALID — each session starts fresh
- Only skip on subsequent `/sc` commands within the SAME session

Ask these FOUR questions:

### Question 1: Session Mode

```
[AskUserQuestion]
header: "Session Mode"
question: "How will you be using this session?"
options:
- "Normal" — I'm here, ask me at decision points
- "Overnight" — Run autonomously, don't wait for input
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Normal** | Pause at checkpoints, ask for confirmation |
| **Overnight** | Auto-select recommended options, log decisions |

**Overnight mode only affects the WORK phase.** Capture (`/sc add`) ALWAYS asks questions in both modes.

### Question 2: Auto-Commit

```
[AskUserQuestion]
header: "Auto-commit"
question: "Auto-commit changes after each task?"
options:
- "Yes" — Commit automatically after each completed task
- "No" — I'll commit manually
```

### Question 3: Playwright Testing

```
[AskUserQuestion]
header: "Auto-testing"
question: "Automated Playwright tests for this session?"
options:
- "Yes" — Generate and run Playwright tests (functionality + UI screenshots)
- "No" — Skip automated testing
```

### Question 4: Plan Verification

```
[AskUserQuestion]
header: "Plan review"
question: "Review implementation plan before proceeding?"
options:
- "Verify with me" — Show plan, ask for approval
- "Continue directly" — Show plan, proceed automatically
```

**Store all four in memory for this session ONLY.**
**NEVER persist to MEMORY.md, auto-memory, or any cross-session file.**

To switch mode mid-session: `/sc mode normal` or `/sc mode overnight`

## Commands

| Command | Action | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/sc map` | map | Deep codebase analysis → CLAUDE.md + CODEBASE_MAP.md |
| `/sc help` | help | Show help documentation with all commands |
| `/sc add <description>` | capture | Capture a new task with smart questioning |
| `/sc work` | work | Process all pending tasks in the queue |
| `/sc batch` | batch | PRD mode — enter multiple tasks with dependency planning |
| `/sc resume` | resume | Continue from where you left off |
| `/sc status` | status | Show current state and pending work |
| `/sc update` | update | Refresh codebase memory after changes |
| `/sc mode <normal\|overnight>` | mode | Switch session mode |
| `/sc upgrade` | upgrade | Update SC framework to latest version |

---

## Routing Decision

### Step 1: Parse the Command

Examine what follows `/sc`:

| Pattern | Example | Route |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Empty or `status` | `/sc` or `/sc status` | → status |
| `map` | `/sc map` | → map (deep codebase analysis) |
| `help` | `/sc help` | → help |
| `add <text>` | `/sc add make it faster` | → capture (with text as input) |
| `work` | `/sc work` | → work (process queue) |
| `batch` | `/sc batch` | → batch (PRD mode) |
| `resume` | `/sc resume` | → resume |
| `update` | `/sc update` | → update (refresh memory) |
| `mode normal` | `/sc mode normal` | → set mode to Normal |
| `mode overnight` | `/sc mode overnight` | → set mode to Overnight |
| `upgrade` | `/sc upgrade` | → upgrade (pull latest framework) |

### Step 2: Extract Payload for add

For `/sc add`, everything after `add ` is the task description:

```
/sc add make the dashboard faster
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        This is the payload → passed to capture action
```

### Step 3: Handle Ambiguous Input

If input doesn't match a known command but has content:
- Treat it as `/sc add <content>`
- Example: `/sc fix the login bug` → routes to capture with "fix the login bug"

---

## Team Features

### Session Locking

When `/sc work` starts, create a lock file:
```bash
echo "Task: [task] | User: $USER | Started: $(date +%H:%M:%S)" > ".claude-team/sessions/$$.lock"
```

Before starting work, check for other active sessions:
```bash
ls .claude-team/sessions/*.lock 2>/dev/null
```

If other sessions active, warn the user about potential conflicts.

Clean up lock on completion.

### Task History

Log every completed task to `.claude-team/history/tasks.jsonl`:
```json
{"date":"2026-03-17","member":"durga","task":"Dashboard optimization","type":"FEATURE","req":"REQ-001","files":["dashboard.php","js/dashboard.js"],"tests":"5/5","commit":"abc1234"}
```

---

## Action References

**IMPORTANT: You MUST read and follow the detailed instructions in the action file for the command being executed.**

When routing to an action, READ THE FULL ACTION FILE before doing anything:

| Command | Action File to READ |
|---------|---------------------|
| `/sc map` | **READ [init action](./actions/init.md) FIRST** |
| `/sc add` | **READ [capture action](./actions/capture.md) FIRST** |
| `/sc work` | **READ [work action](./actions/work.md) FIRST** |
| `/sc batch` | **READ [batch action](./actions/batch.md) FIRST** |
| `/sc status` | **READ [status action](./actions/status.md) FIRST** |
| `/sc help` | **READ [help action](./actions/help.md) FIRST** |
| `/sc update` | **READ [update action](./actions/update.md) FIRST** |

**DO NOT improvise. DO NOT skip reading the action file.**

## Folder Structure

### SHARED (everyone reads, /sc:map creates)
```
CLAUDE.md                        # Project knowledge base (SHARED)
.claude-team/                    # Team state (SHARED)
├── CODEBASE_MAP.md             # Detailed file/function/UI index
├── SYSTEM_PROMPT.md            # Task workflow rules
├── initialized                  # Marker file (from /sc:map)
├── sessions/                    # Session locks (team)
└── history/
    └── tasks.jsonl             # Task history log (all users)
```

### PER-USER (each user gets their own workspace under pp/$USER/)
```
pp/
├── durga/                       # durga's workspace
│   ├── REQ-001-task.md         # durga's pending queue
│   ├── STATE.md                # durga's current state
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── test-env.json       # durga's test credentials (gitignored)
│   ├── rephrased/              # durga's optimized prompts
│   ├── plans/                  # durga's implementation plans
│   ├── research/               # durga's auto-research docs
│   ├── user-requests/          # durga's verbatim input
│   ├── working/                # durga's in-progress tasks
│   └── archive/                # durga's completed work
│
├── john/                        # john's workspace (separate)
│   ├── REQ-001-task.md         # john's own queue (independent)
│   ├── STATE.md                # john's own state
│   ├── working/
│   └── archive/
│
└── ...                          # more users as needed

tests/
└── pp/                          # Playwright tests (shared — committed to git)
    ├── REQ-001-task.spec.js
    └── screenshots/
        └── REQ-001/
```

### CRITICAL: User Isolation Rules
- **`pp/$USER/`** — each user ONLY reads/writes their own folder
- **`$USER`** is determined by the system `$USER` environment variable
- **REQ numbering** is per-user (durga's REQ-001 ≠ john's REQ-001)
- **STATE.md** is per-user — each user tracks their own progress
- **config/test-env.json** is per-user — different credentials allowed
- **CLAUDE.md + CODEBASE_MAP.md** are SHARED — everyone reads, auto-update writes
- **history/tasks.jsonl** is SHARED — all users' completions logged here
- **Session locks** are SHARED — so users can see who else is working
